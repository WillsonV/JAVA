## Collection Framework

### Purpose: 
     >   To represent many values by using single object. 
     
**Problem**: To represent 10k values we declare 10k variables. By doing this the readability of the program is going to be down and this is worst kind of programming. To overcome this, we can go for arrays and collections.

**Arrays**: Student[] s = new Student[10000];
We can represent huge no of homogeneous type of elements by using single object(variable) with arrays.
